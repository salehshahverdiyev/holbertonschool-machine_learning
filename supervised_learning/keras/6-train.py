        trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent:
        network is the model to train
        data is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, nx) containing the input data
        labels is a one-hot numpy.ndarray of
            shape (m, classes) containing the labels of data
        batch_size is the size of the batch used
            for mini-batch gradient descent
        epochs is the number of passes through data
            for mini-batch gradient descent
        verbose is a boolean that determines if output
            should be printed during training
        shuffle is a boolean that determines whether to shuffle
            the batches every epoch.
            Normally, it is a good idea to shuffle, but for reproducibility,
                we have chosen to set the default to False.
        validation_data is the data to validate the model with, if not None
        early_stopping is a boolean that indicates whether
            early stopping should be used
        early stopping should only be performed if validation_data exists
        early stopping should be based on validation loss
        patience is the patience used for early stopping
        Returns: the History object generated after training the model
