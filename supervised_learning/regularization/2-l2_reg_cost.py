        Calculates the cost of a neural network with L2 regularization:
        cost is a tensor containing the cost of the network
            without L2 regularization.
        model is a Keras model that includes layers with L2 regularization
        Returns: a tensor containing the total cost for each
            layer of the network, accounting for L2 regularization.
