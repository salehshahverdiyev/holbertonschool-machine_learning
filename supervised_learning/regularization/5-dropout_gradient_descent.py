    updates the weights of a neural network with Dropout.
        regularization using gradient descent:
    Y is a one-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (classes, m)
        that contains the correct labels for the data.
        classes is the number of classes
        m is the number of data points
    weights is a dictionary of the weights and biases of the neural network
    cache is a dictionary of the outputs and
        dropout masks of each layer of the neural network.
    alpha is the learning rate
    keep_prob is the probability that a node will be kept
    L is the number of layers of the network
    All layers use thetanh activation function except the last,
        which uses the softmax activation function.
    The weights of the network should be updated in place
